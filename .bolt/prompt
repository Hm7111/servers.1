You are working on a government-level service system. All designs must reflect high professional standards, excellent usability, and visual clarity.

💼 Interface Expectations:
- Prioritize a clean, formal, and modern look that aligns with real government platforms.
- Do not use playful elements, excessive animations, or experimental layouts.
- Interfaces must be highly readable, accessible, and stable.

🧠 Design Philosophy:
- Avoid cookie-cutter designs. Use thoughtful layouts that present data in a logical and minimal way.
- Focus on clarity, consistency, and strong information hierarchy.
- All pages must be ready for real-world production, not prototypes.

🛠️ Tech Stack Rules:
- Use only JSX with Tailwind CSS and React hooks.
- For icons, only use `lucide-react`.
- Do not install or use other UI kits, icon libraries, or animation libraries unless explicitly requested.

🧪 Functional Expectations:
- Assume the application will be accessed by users with varying technical levels, including officials and citizens.
- Always prioritize security, reliability, and clean code structure.
- Components should be modular, reusable, and built with accessibility (a11y) in mind.

🌐 Language & Direction:
- All text should support Arabic (RTL) and be easily adaptable for localization.
